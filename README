This package contains some scripts to ease the setup and maintenance of a local
GIT mirror.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- git-mirror
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script can be used to create a local mirror of an existing 
GIT server that is using gitweb interface, such as http://git.kernel.org.

The script will first fetch the list of all projects on the server,
and then it will update the local mirror:
- adding new created trees
- removing trees that were deleted on the main server
- updating existing trees

Note: this is only working if the remote GIT server is using the gitweb 
interface, since it relies on the gitweb project list download link.

Improvements are much than welcome!

Example: ./git-mirror -o /var/www/git/ \
                      -s http://git.omapzoom.org \
                      -g git://git.omapzoom.org

This example will download all trees available on omapzoom git server.

Once the initial mirror is done, running this command again will only fetch
the changes.

Don't forget to use the '-n' option first to check what will be done by
the script.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- git-update-me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This scripts assumes that the local GIT server is 'mirroring' a custom list of 
git trees on various git servers. Unlike git-mirror, which mirrors the whole 
remote server, this script can be used to cherry-pick some trees.

It requires that the trees are initially cloned on the local server first, with
git clone --mirror git://xxxxx

The script uses a configuration file that lists all mirror'd trees on the local
server.
